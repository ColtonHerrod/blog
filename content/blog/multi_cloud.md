Short answer: No.

Long answer: Probably not, but it depends on why you're asking the question.  If your organization is discussing multi-cloud architecture for DR or avoiding lock-in, then your organization almost certainly has no need to use multiple cloud platforms.  The two questions that inform this decision should be:
1. Will your organization would use any unique features of the two clouds?
2. Is dealing with the operational overhead that comes with splitting an application across two data centers worth these unique features?
