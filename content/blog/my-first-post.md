summary: Beginning a blog,   `print "Hello World!"`

Hi all,

Starting to host a blog to test out Azure and the Hugo framework.  Not yet sure what I'll be using it for, but I expect it'll be for technical tidbits and random thoughts.

I've currently got the pipelines set up to make this painless to update (hopefully) using Azure Blob Storage, Azure CDN, and GitHub.  I may add a post detailing that process here soon.  Until then, take care!
