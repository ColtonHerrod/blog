I am a DevOps engineer based in Norman, Oklahoma.  I specialize in AWS cloud technologies, with a primary focus on developer-driven infrastructure, workload automation, and data center migration.

I started my career as a software engineer at Pariveda Solutions, where I worked as a DevOps consultant between 2015 and 2020.  I am currently a DevOps engineer at DTN.

I spend my free time reading and writing sci-fi, fantasy, and history, hiking, camping, and biking.
