I am a DevOps consultant based in Dallas, Texas.  I specialize in AWS cloud technologies, with a primary focus on DevOps, workload automation, and data center migration.

I started my career as a software enginner at Pariveda Solutions, where I have been for nearly five years.

My free time is spent reading and writing sci-fi and fantasy, hiking, and camping.
